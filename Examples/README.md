# Gibberish Text

https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/gibberish_text

This validator validates the "cleanliness" of the text generated by a language model. It uses a pre-trained model to determine if the text is coherent and not gibberish. The validator can be used to filter out text that is not coherent or does not make sense.

```powershell
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/gibberish_text
```

# Toxic Language

https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/toxic_language

This validator uses the pre-trained multi-label model from Detoxify to check whether the generated text is toxic.

```powershell
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/toxic_language
```

# Profanity Free

https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/profanity_free

This validator ensures that thereâ€™s no profanity in any generated text. 

```powershell
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/profanity_free

# Provenance Embeddings

https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/provenance_embeddings

This validator uses embedding similarity to check if an LLM generated text can be supported by the sources. 

```powershell
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/provenance_embeddings
```

# Provenance LLM => buggy

https://hub.guardrailsai.com/validator/guardrails/provenance_llm

# Grounded AI Hallucination => buggy

This validator uses a fine-tuned language model to detect hallucinations in AI-generated responses. It evaluates whether a given response is grounded in the provided context or if it contains factually incorrect or nonsensical information.

```powershell
guardrails hub install hub://groundedai/grounded_ai_hallucination
```
